400
  The status code means that it has a bad request"
The most common reason for a 400 Bad Request error is because the URL was typed wrong or the link that was clicked on points to a malformed URL with a specific kind of mistake like syntax problem. 
To fix the problem we should check for non-allowed, characters in the URL like a percentage character. While there are perfectly valid uses for something like a % character, you won't often find one in a standard URL."

{
  "code": 401,
  "message": "Unauthorized"
}

The status code means = The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled. the unauthorized access means that the user does not have valid authentication credentials for the target resource.
Some sites incorrectly issue HTTP 401 when an IP address is banned from the website. 
To fix the problem we should reload the page. As simple as it might seem, closing down the page and reopening it might be enough to fix the 401 error, but only if it's caused by a misleader page.
If you're sure the URL is valid, visit the website's main page and look for a link that says Login or Secure Access. Enter your credentials here and then try the page again.

2.5
403
The status code means that the request was valid, but the server is refusing action. The user might not have the necessary permissions for a resource, or may need an account of some sort. This code is also typically used if the request provided authentication via the WWW-Authenticate header field, but the server did not accept that authentication.
To fix the 403 error you should first clear the browser's the caches version of the page  could cause 403 forbidden error
or we can create and additional additional access before viewing the page.
